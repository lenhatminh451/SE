# Identify the context of this project
## Stakeholders:
Stakeholders can be individuals or organizations that influence or are affected by the system
in some way and they are legally bound to the system. The stakeholders of this software are
identified as:
- Back officers: can check the tasks status, design a new plan, check many resources,
manage and track workers to optimize work progress.
- Collectors: get the tasks, view the route, location and complete the works on time.
- Janitors: be notified when collectors are coming, get the tasks and communicate to finish
on time.
## Their current problem:
- The large number of workers leads to back officers’ difficulty to manage and allocate the
human resource. In addition, poor management causes great loss of labor and equipment
- The driver’s route at a non-optimal distance causes waste of time and fuel, and affects the
work progress.
- Staff’s lack of connection with each other and the delayed update of MCPs makes the work
process not conducted in a swift manner.
## Expected features:
In order to meet the needs of each user, it is expected that this software includes:
- Easy to manage workers and their resources.
- Intuitive statistics, easy to view and categorize about work performance.
- All in one app provides them to connect to the others faster with lower latency by various
methods (call via app, via phone numbers, messages).
- Including Google Maps and a new engine to find out the best way for their route to reduce
both time and fuel.
- Integrating a calculating engine and tracking system to predict the remaining time that
collectors arrive.
- Notification classification makes it easy for users to reach.
- Can upgrade and expand in the future.
- --
To help this software running effectively, we needs:
- Each employer has a smartphone or Laptop to install this app.
- Need to turn on and allow to access location (only collectors and janitors)
- Exclude from system battery saver mode during work to help tracking more accuracy.

# Functional and non-functional requirements
## Functional requirements
The functional requirements for each user object in turn are as follows:
###  Back officers:
  - As a back officer, I can get detailed information about workers tasks and route.
- As a back officer, I want to have a map with MCPs and tracking the worker’s location.
- As a back officer, I believe this app let us create a plan, Intelligent Routing for workers
and assign the task.
- As a back officer, I want the system that calculates the optimized way for collectors
based on distance and fuel consumption.
- As a back officer, I am able to get data about their resources and equipment.
- As a back officer, I want the system is updated every 15 minutes about the status of
MCPs.
- As a back officer, I can send messages and notify newly announcements to the workers,
so that the direct communication should be integrated
- As a back officer, I desire a system that will assist me in gathering and analyzing data
in order to effectively plan tasks.
### Collectors and Janitors:
- As a janitor and a collector, I want the system can be able to check in and check out
since I log in/out in the system.
- As a janitor and a collector, I want the system has a visual tasks, route and calendar
constantly updated.
- As a janitor and a collector, I wish important information will be listed first in order
not to miss any things else.
- As a janitor and a collector, I want to be informed when MCPs’s capacity is full.
- As a janitor and a collector, I want the communication feature that we want to com-
municate with back officers and each other for exchange and update information.
- As a janitor, I want to report an unexpected incident which is one of our favorite
function to inform the officers so as to change route as soon as possible.
- As a collector, I want to be able to keep track of what the janitors have done or not.


## Non-functional requirements
### Performance:
- As a user, I believe this app performing with low latency (<=1000 ms) for each action
in order to that I can work with it smoothly.
- As a user, I want it use less resources, only 300mb ram using during running so as to
be suitable for most of general users.
### Reliability:
- As a user, I want process is already for work-shift to work with me together.
- Crashing time less than 4s in every day is one of important parts that the user like
me can work without interrupting.
### Organization:
- As users, I believe it is able to update and expand in the coming years when our
company will become huge.
- As a user, I wish UI and UX are clear, simple to use and optimal to run for us easy
to use.
- Main function needs appearing in the first time open app when I open this app to
reduce step.
- The color scheme of the software needs to be intuitive, pleasant, avoid causing eye
strain or distraction while in use, and ensure the brand identity is a part which is
important to identity our company.
### Legal requirements:
- As a user, I want the software must comply with the laws and regulations of the host
country for us to make income.
- As a user, I want this app prevent bad guys from taking advantage of software for
purposes other than the original purpose
